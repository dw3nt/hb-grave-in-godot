## Why convert this to Godot?

This repository is my attempts at creating **Grave** by following the tutorial series above, but using Godot instead of GameMaker. The goal of this repository is strictly educational and to continue to improve upon my skills in Godot and game development in general. I've followed many of **HeartBeast's** tutorials on game development in GameMaker Studio and in Godot, and cannot recommend them enough.
 
I feel the next step in my game development education is translating ideas into Godot. Specifically, translating game and design ideas into Godot scenes and nodes. To that end, I will watching the above tutorials for **Grave**, which I completed in GameMaker Studio a little while back, and translating the game into Godot. 

The goal is that once I'm finished, there will be a branch for each video in his series so others can compare their results to mine, in hopes that any information I learn through this project can be shared with and helpful to others. This project is by no means perfect. I'm sure there are bugs, and I'm sure there are things that could have been done better. I challenge others to challenge themselves in similar ways, and to learn from my journey of going through this series. From simply comparing different solutions for the same problem, to learning from my mistakes.
